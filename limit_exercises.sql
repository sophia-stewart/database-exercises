/* The limit specifies how many rows will appear on each page and the offset specifies at what point to begin displaying data and which page number will be shown.
Handy dandy formula found at https://www.petefreitag.com/item/451.cfm :
offset = (limit * pageNumber) - limit

offset = (5 * 10) - 5
offset = 45
