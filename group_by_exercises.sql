-- GROUP BY EXERCISES
USE employees;

-- 2. In your script, use DISTINCT to find the unique titles in the titles table. How many unique titles have there ever been? Answer that in a comment in your SQL file.
SELECT DISTINCT title
FROM titles;
-- There are 7 unique titles.

-- 3. Write a query to to find a list of all unique last names of all employees that start and end with 'E' using GROUP BY.
SELECT last_name
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE 'E%E'
GROUP BY last_name;

-- 4. Write a query to to find all unique combinations of first and last names of all employees whose last names start and end with 'E'.
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE 'E%E'
GROUP BY full_name;

-- 5. Write a query to find the unique last names with a 'q' but not 'qu'. Include those names in a comment in your sql code.
SELECT last_name
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE '%q%'
AND NOT last_name LIKE '%qu%'
GROUP BY last_name;
-- Chleq, Lindqvist, Qiwen

-- 6. Add a COUNT() to your results (the query above) to find the number of employees with the same last name.
SELECT last_name,
       COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE '%q%'
AND NOT last_name LIKE '%qu%'
GROUP BY last_name;

-- 7. Find all all employees with first names 'Irena', 'Vidya', or 'Maya'. Use COUNT(*) and GROUP BY to find the number of employees for each gender with those names.
SELECT first_name,
       gender,
       COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE first_name IN ('Irena', 'Vidya', 'Maya')
GROUP BY first_name, gender
ORDER BY first_name;

-- 8. Using your query that generates a username for all of the employees, generate a count employees for each unique username. Are there any duplicate usernames? BONUS: How many duplicate usernames are there?
SELECT lower(
         CONCAT(
          SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 1),
          SUBSTR(last_name, 1, 4),
          '_',
            SUBSTR(birth_date, 6, 2),
          SUBSTR(birth_date, 3, 2)
       )) AS username,
       COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY username
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
-- There are duplicate usernames.
SELECT lower(
         CONCAT(
          SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 1),
          SUBSTR(last_name, 1, 4),
          '_',
            SUBSTR(birth_date, 6, 2),
          SUBSTR(birth_date, 3, 2)
       )) AS username,
       COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY username
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- There are 13251 usernames with duplicates.

-- 9. More practice with aggregate functions:
-- 9a. Find the historic average salary for all employees. Now determine the current average salary.
SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM salaries;

-- 9b. Now find the historic average salary for each employee. Reminder that when you hear "for each" in the problem statement, you'll probably be grouping by that exact column.
SELECT emp_no,
       AVG(salary) AS historic_avg_salary
FROM salaries
GROUP BY emp_no;

-- 9c. Find the current average salary for each employee.
SELECT emp_no,
       AVG(salary) AS current_avg_salary
FROM salaries
WHERE to_date > CURDATE()
GROUP BY emp_no;

-- 9d. Find the maximum salary for each current employee.
SELECT emp_no,
       MAX(salary)
FROM salaries
WHERE to_date > CURDATE()
GROUP BY emp_no;

-- 9e. Now find the max salary for each current employee where that max salary is greater than $150,000.
SELECT emp_no,
       MAX(salary)
FROM salaries
WHERE to_date > CURDATE()
GROUP BY emp_no
HAVING MAX(salary) > 150000;

-- 9f. Find the current average salary for each employee where that average salary is between $80k and $90k.
SELECT emp_no,
       AVG(salary)
FROM salaries
WHERE to_date > CURDATE()
GROUP BY emp_no
HAVING AVG(salary) BETWEEN 80000 AND 90000;
